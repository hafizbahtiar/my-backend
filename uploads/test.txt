## Usage:

```bash
# Upload a file via API
curl -X POST http://localhost:7000/api/user/avatar \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -F "avatar=@image.jpg"

# Access the uploaded file
curl http://localhost:7000/uploads/avatar-123.jpg
```

## File URLs:

When you upload a file, the API returns a URL like:
- `/uploads/avatar-1234567890.jpg`
- `/uploads/document-1234567890.pdf`

These URLs are now accessible via the static file serving middleware.
